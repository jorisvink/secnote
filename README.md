## notes

There may be different reasons for marking a section of code as
a secnote. Perhaps a design decision, or a belt and suspender.

It is hard to classify certain parts of code as security critical
while leaving out other parts.

Security encompasses the entire code base.

However, secnote should make it easier to digest code and
understand which parts of it relate to security or potentially
even are security critical without intimate understanding of the code.

As with everything related to comments and documentation, if it
falls out of touch with reality it will become useless and could
even turn into a security risk.
